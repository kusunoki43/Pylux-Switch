# Pylux — Community Fork (Android only)

> This is an **Android-only fork** of [Pylux](https://github.com/ForWard-Technologies-LLC/Pylux). It adds cloud streaming quality-of-life features, performance diagnostics, and build fixes. Non-Android platforms are untouched.

**Pylux is a free, open-source, community build PS4 and PS5 Remote Play client for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, and Steam Deck.** It focuses on app-store installs, Internet Play (streaming the game catalog or your owned games), automatic console discovery, and a touch-friendly mobile UI — all from one community-maintained codebase.

## Fork Features (Android)

These features are **exclusive to this fork** — not yet present in the upstream release.

### Performance Overlay
Three-column diagnostic overlay showing real-time stream quality metrics during all session types (Remote Play, PS Now, PS Cloud).

| Column | Metrics |
|--------|---------|
| **Latency** | Total latency (network + decode), network RTT, decode time |
| **Stream** | FPS with sparkline, bitrate in Mbps, resolution |
| **Quality** | RTT, jitter, decode time, video packet loss, cumulative frame drops |

- Toggle from Settings → Performance overlay or in-stream button
- Polled every 1s via RxJava from JNI SessionMetrics
- EMA-smoothed decode time measured at video decoder output thread
- Kotlin-side jitter computed as std dev over 30-sample sliding window
- Monospace TextViews + SparklineView (no Canvas)

### Cloud Language Picker
Settings → General → Cloud Language dropdown. Select the language for cloud streamed games.

- **5 languages** matching available datacenters: English, Deutsch, Français, Suomi, English (UK)
- **Auto-datacenter matching**: selecting a language automatically locks the corresponding server (Deutsch → Frankfurt, Finnish → Stockholm, etc.)
- **Language filtering**: only shows languages that have matching datacenters in your ping results
- Games now respect your chosen language when paired with the correct datacenter

### Datacenter Display in Overlay
The overlay header shows the actual selected server name (e.g. `Cloud Play • fraa`) instead of a generic label. Wired through the full allocation pipeline: `AllocationResult → CloudStreamSession → ConnectInfo`.

### Frame Drops Tracking
The drops counter in the overlay now reflects **actual frame loss** from chiaki's video receiver, not just codec buffer overflows. Previously, `frames_lost` was ignored — drops stayed at zero even on unstable connections.

### Build Stability
- Fixed CMake version mismatch (3.30.4 → 3.22.1 for AGP 8.5.2)
- Fixed C++ standard conflict (C++14 → C++17 for oboe)
- Fixed Java home path in gradle.properties
- Removed stale `server_rtt` reference in JNI
- Removed orphaned `input.release()` call

## Upstream PR

All fork changes are submitted to upstream via **[PR #21](https://github.com/ForWard-Technologies-LLC/Pylux/pull/21)**.

## Key Discoveries (2026-06-22)

- **Game language is tied to datacenter region.** Selecting a language without a matching datacenter has no effect — Gaikai ignores the mismatch.
- **Gaikai expects bare language codes** (`"de"`, `"en"`) not full locales (`"de-DE"`, `"en-US"`), though both are accepted.
- **PSN account region determines available datacenters.** A Finnish account (`country: FI`) gets Nordic servers (Stockholm), not German ones.
- **Sony caps cloud streams at ~50 Mbps** for 4K. The measured bitrate in the overlay confirms actual throughput.
